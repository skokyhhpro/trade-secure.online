<p style="color: white;">Trading CFDs (&ldquo;Trading&rdquo;) means that a contract is being created which gives the Client the right to estimate the direction of the change in price of an underlying asset, within a certain time frame determined by the Company. This trading instrument is different from trading ‘options&sbquo; in a traditional way, since there is a fixed return that is determined at the outset of the trade.<br>
1.    The Trading Account</p>
<p>1.1    Account Opening – The Client may apply for an account through the Company&sbquo;s website and the Company will accept such an application creating the &ldquo;Trading Account&rdquo;, under the following terms: (i) the Company has received confirmation that the Client has agreed to enter into this Agreement (such confirmation can be made by checking the &ldquo;I AGREE&rdquo; button or link on the Company&sbquo;s website (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;), followed by a completed application form (if applicable) and all other Client information, the provision of which may be required by the Company. The Client confirms that Client&sbquo;s information is full, accurate and complete. If there is a change in the information provided by the Client, the Client must notify the Company immediately.</p>
<p>1.2    Usage of the Trading Platform is made through the Account by a limited license provided by the Company to the Client. The license is personal, non-transferable and is for persons who are older than 18 years old (or older legal age, if the law applicable to the Client&sbquo;s jurisdictions requires a higher legal age) and subject to this Agreement. The Client will not transfer, assign, or enable other to make any use of the license, and/or give the Client&sbquo;s access codes to the Trading Account to anyone. Any damage caused to the Client, the Company and any third party due to breach of this Agreement by Client, shall be under the Client&sbquo;s sole responsibility.</p>
<p>1.3     Account Upgrade - An account upgrade is compulsory on all active trading accounts, therefore all clients are to upgrade their accounts.</p>
<p>1.4    Activation of the Trading Account – The Account will be activated by the Company as soon as the Company has identified the funds credited by the Client to the Trading Account. The Company may activate the Trading Account and permit trading in the Trading Account subject to such limitations, and to the satisfaction of such further requirements as the Company may impose. Where a Trading Account is not activated or is frozen, no funds held by the Company in respect of that Trading Account may be transferred back or to any other person until the Company is satisfied that all Applicable Regulations have been complied with.</p>
<p>1.5    The Company may act, according to the Company&sbquo;s sole discretion, as principal or as agent on the Client&sbquo;s behalf in relation to any Transaction entered into pursuant to the Agreement. Therefore the Company may act as the counter party to the Client&sbquo;s trading activity. The Client confirms that it acts as the sole principal and not as agent or trustee on behalf of someone else.</p>
<p>1.6    The Client hereby represents and warrants that his engagement with the Company in this Agreement and his use of the Company&sbquo;s services are in full compliance with the law applicable to the Client.</p>

For determining the quotes for different time periods, the platform makes mathematical calculations according to known and accepted capital markets formulas. It is acknowledged by both Parties that due to different calculation methods and other circumstances, different trading platforms and/or markets may display different price quotes.</p>
<p>2.2   The Client will receive a predetermined pay-out if their CFD transaction expires in-the-money, and he will lose a predetermined amount of his investment on the Transaction if the option expires out-of-the-money. The predetermined amounts are a derivative of the collateral invested in the transaction by the Client, and will be published on the Trading Platform. The degree to which the option is in-the-money or out-of-the-money does not matter as it does with traditional options.</p>
<p>2.3   The Client authorizes the Company to rely and act on any order, request, instruction or other communication given or made (or purporting to be given or made) by the Client or any person authorized on the Client&sbquo;s behalf, without further inquiry on the part of the Company as to the authenticity, genuineness authority or identity of the person giving or purporting to give such order, request, instruction or other communication.

<p>2.6   Cancel Feature Abuse<br>
The Company offers a special cancellation feature that allows traders to cancel a trade within a few seconds of execution. Abuse of the cancellation feature can be considered market arbitrage and can result in forfeiture of profits. Company reserves the right to cancel a position if the cancellation feature is abused. The acceptable cancellation percentage cannot exceed 20% of the total number of executed trades. Cancelling more than 20% of the total number of executed trades is considered abuse of this feature and resulting profits may be forfeited from such abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The Client will not have any proprietary claim over money transferred to the Company, and the Company can deal with these funds in its own right. In determining the amount of collateral and the amount of the Company&sbquo;s obligations to pay or return money to the Client, the Company may apply such methodology (including judgments as to the future movement of markets and values), as the Company considers appropriate.</p>
<p>3.4   The Funds deposited with the Company by the Client, together with any Profit or other Benefits the Client may be entitled to according to any specific agreement with the Company, shall be used as security for any Transaction, including Trading Losses, Commission and any other fee or debt owed by the Client to the Company, which will be automatically deducted from the Client&sbquo;s Trading Account equity.

Although the risk when trading CFDs is fixed for each individual trade, the trades are live and it is possible to lose an initial investment, particularly if a trader chooses to place his entire investment to a single live trade. It is highly recommended that traders choose a proper money management strategy which limits the total consecutive trades or total outstanding investment.</p>
